Welcome to the BlurImage .
*  This is a simple repository that explains from scratch the working of **N-TAP GAUSSIAN FILTER** . 
* This project is not suitable for compilation into real time applications as this calculation is bit heavier that it takes around 20 seconds to blur an image.
*  This is best useful for study purposes.
